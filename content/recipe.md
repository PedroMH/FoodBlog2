See the instructions on the packet and Boil the noodles until it’s cooked. 

While the noodles are cooking, Take a separate pan and heat the oil. When oil is hot enough add garlic and saute for 1-2 minutes. When garlic turns a little brown add in onion and saute for 2-3 minutes until it’s slightly cooked. 

When the onions are done add in the chicken. Cook it for 10 minutes on a medium flame. 
Now, add in all the seasoning. Saute for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, start blanching pak choi. 
When chicken is cooked. Add in tomatoes and cook until it turns into gravy.
