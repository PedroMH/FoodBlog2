Spicy chili oil, crunchy peanuts with spiced chicken make these noodles delicious. Packed with different flavors, this just might be the noodles you need for that zing. 

Ingredients 

Noodle of your choice 
½ Tbsp olive oil
4 cloves of garlic, cut 
1 medium onion, cut
200g ground chicken 
1 medium tomato
Handful of chopped coriander 

Seasoning 
1tsb turmeric powder 
1tsp coriander powder 
1tsb meat masala
1tsb chili powder
1tsb Salt 
1tbsp Soy sauce 


For serving 
1tbsp Chili oil with peanuts 
Sichuan pepper 
Blanched Pak choi  

Direction 

See the instructions on the packet and boil the noodles until they’re cooked. 

While the noodles are cooking, take a separate pan and heat the oil. When the oil is hot enough add the garlic and saute for 1-2 minutes. When the garlic turns little brown add in the onion and saute for 2-3 minutes until they’re slightly cooked. 

When the onions are done, add in the chicken. Cook it for 10 minutes on a medium flame. 
Now, add in all the seasoning. Saute for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, start blanching pak choi. 
When chicken is cooked. Add in the tomatoes and cook until it turns into gravy. 
Turn off the heat, add the coriander and give it a mix. 


Plating 
 
Add chili oil in a bowl with some Sichuan pepper. Then add the noodles on top of the sauce with a good amount of spiced chicken. Finish it off by adding some pak choi. 

Note 

When the noodles were almost done, I added pak choi to be blanched. It saves time and water.
